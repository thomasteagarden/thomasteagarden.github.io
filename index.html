    <hr>
    <h3> Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        My informal code review coveres three artifacts that I have created throughout my computer science educational journey.  During the code review, I analyzed
        each artifact for errors, structure, vulnerabilites, architecture, and best practices.  For this presentation, I used Visual Studio Code to present the code, cover syntax,
        and structure.  The video uses a voice over narration to explain the elements of the code, identify areas of improvment, and futher explain my proposed enhancements.
    </p>
    <p>
        To align with course objectives, I provided an indepth review that delivers a professional, coherent, and technically sound presentation.

    <h2>Project Enhancements</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Software Design and Engineering</h3>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p element class="subsection-content">
        This artifact was created in CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle.  The artifact is a very simple program that calculates compound interest based on a few user inputs.  
        The artifact was created on April 10, 2023, and it was one of the first projects I created. 
    </p>
    <h4>Artifact Signficance</h4>
    <p>
        I chose this artifact because it was one of the first programs that I created in C++.  I selected this item because going from where I was when I started programming to now is quite a large leap and 
        improving on this program will showcase that growth.  I have learned many programming languages since creating this project and I want to showcase my ability to work in multiple languages, with the goal 
        of recreating this project in Python and Java. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The artifact was improved by creating a more interactive and cleaner user interface.  Additionally, the output is enhanced by creating better columns and output for the user to view.  I implemented a CSV 
        report in the Java version that saves the report to the local directory for future use.  Lastly, I was able to clean up the code and more it more concise to allow for better function, performance, and 
        stability.
    </p>
    <h4>Course Objective</h4>
    <p>
        The outcome that I set out to achieve is:
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                To demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions 
                that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        I believe that I have reached this goal through the dynamic and structural enhancements that I have made to this program.
    </p>
    <h4> Overcoming Challenges</h4>
    <p>
        The process of enhancing and modifying the artifact started with the code review.  I was able to reflect on my previous work and identify areas of improvement.  During the code review I realized that several 
        lines of code could be combined and some of the calculations could be completed in a single step rather than having multiple lines of code.  This made it so the code was cleaner, well organized, and reduced 
        the computer processing requirements.

    <h3>Algorithms and Data Structure</h3>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p class="subsection-content">
        The artifact that I chose for this enhancement was from CS 320: Software Test, Automation, and Quality Assurance.  This project was created on July 28, 2024, and it aligns with the algorithm and data 
        structures through the efficient use of classes and services. This program uses a multifaceted class structure, as well as importing data from a document.  Additionally, within this code, there are basic 
        algorithms that are used, which make it a great contender for this category.  I can implement changes and enhancements both in structure and algorithmic logic.  The program was coded in Java.
    </p>
    <h4>Artifact Signficance</h4>
    <p>
        This artifact shows the importance and use of algorithms, data structure, and the use of multiple classes across different files to create a project.  It was the perfect selection for my ePortfolio because it 
        showcases how multiple files are used to create a single program, and it also incorporates Junit tests to make sure the program is running properly.  My enhancements for this project were vast.  I included 
        sort and filter algorithms for each class that allows the user to quickly find the information they are looking for within the program.  Additionally, I improved the class structure, the unit tests, as well 
        as streamlined the program to make everything clear, concise, and easy to use.  I implemented best practices by keeping the code organized, easy to understand and follow, and condensed lines where I could. 
    </p>
    <h4>Course Objective</h4>
    <p>
        I accomplished my goal of meeting the following objectives:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs 
                involved in design choices. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish 
                industry-specific goals.
            </li>
            <li>
                Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced 
                    security of data and resources.
                </li>
        </ul>
        <br>  I was able to create a product using best practices, enhancing the algorithms that allowed for better sorting, filtering, and enhancement of the data.  Using the J-Unit tests, I increased the validity 
        and security of the program because I was able to test the input and operation of the program.  This reduces errors, misinformation, and overall security of the program.
    </p>
    <h4> Overcoming Challenges</h4>
    <p>
        I was met with serval challenges with this program because of the multiple classes and tests.  Each file had to connect and call items from other parts of the program, so keeping the names, variables, and 
        structure consistent was a little tricky.  Additionally, when I was creating the sorting and filtering algorithms, it was difficult to understand what exactly I was trying to do.  Through trial and error, 
        I was able to create a working product.

    <h3>Databases</h3>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>
       The artifact that I choose for this enhancement was from CS 340: Client/Server Development created on December 18, 2024.  The artifact is a web-based database for sheltered dogs and cats that lists pet 
       information retrieved from a MongoDB database.
    </p>
    <h4>Artifact Signficance</h4>
    <p>
        This artifact shows the importance and use of databases.  It was the perfect selection for my ePortfolio because it showcases how to create, setup, and use a database in conjunction with a user interface.  
        My enhancements for this project were vast.  It includes a better search tool for finding the correct animals.  It implements tests for the CRUD functions, and it allows for better connection of the database
         using a standalone juypter notebook or visual studio code.  The original program was created in Apollo remote desktop, so I had to port everything over to my local machine and edit the code to make it work.
          I also streamlined the CRUD2.py by using coding best practices to implement the code in a more secure and concise manner.  Additionally, I enhanced the user interface, making a more user-friendly version 
          of the product.
    </p>
    <h4>Course Objective</h4>
    <p>
        I accomplished my goal of meeting the following objectives:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs 
                involved in design choices. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish 
                industry-specific goals.
            </li>
        </ul>
        I was able to create a product using best practices, enhancing the algorithms that allowed for better sorting and pet management, and I helped the industry become stronger by allowing the dashboard and 
        databases talk to one another in a manner that is both intrinsic and meaningful.
    </p>
    <h4> Overcoming Challenges</h4>
    <p>
        Trying to use MongoDB on my personal computer and creating and connecting to the database was difficult since the program was designed for the remote connection learning environment.  I had to change some of 
        the commands, so they were able to work with my local machine.  I also had to re-create the users for the database and give the correct permissions for user access.  This reinforced the importance of user 
        roles and keeping users separate in their access to the database.  I ran into a lot of debugging issues, but overall, the project was a success.
