                Through this program, I have progressed from writing my first lines of code to designing and implementing a complete full stack development environment capable of supporting real-world client needs. I have gained experience 
                building responsive front-end interfaces, robust back-end logic, and efficient database structures — integrating them to deliver cohesive, maintainable, and secure applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout this journey, I have developed a wide range of hard skills, including:
            </p>
            <ul>

            <p>
                A key lesson reinforced throughout my coursework and projects is the importance of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Applying SDLC principles has allowed me to approach development in a systematic, organized, and 
            goal-oriented way. By following each phase — planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance — I ensure that my solutions meet client requirements, adhere to high standards of quality, and remain 
                adaptable to future changes.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Areas and Their Importance</h3>
            <p>
                <h4>Collaborating in a Team Environment:</h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my projects, I have learned to work collaboratively in diverse teams, using version control systems like Git to manage contributions and resolve conflicts. I have participated in code reviews, 
                stand-up meetings, and agile sprint planning. These experiences have strengthened my ability to share ideas, listen to feedback, and support teammates to achieve common goals.
            </p>
            <h4>Communicating with Stakeholders:</h4>
            <p>
                Effective communication with stakeholders is crucial to delivering software that truly meets user needs. I have practiced presenting technical solutions in clear, non-technical language, gathering requirements 
                through interviews and feedback sessions, and providing status updates to keep stakeholders informed and engaged throughout the project lifecycle.
            </p>
            <h4>Data Structures and Algorithms:</h4>
            <p>
                A deep understanding of data structures and algorithms underpins efficient, optimized code. This knowledge enables me to choose the right structures (such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and hash maps) and algorithms 
                (sorting, searching, recursion) to solve problems effectively and scale applications for performance.
            </p>
            <h4>Software Engineering and Database:</h4>
            <p>
                Applying software engineering principles ensures that my applications are reliable, maintainable, and scalable. I have designed modular, reusable code and followed design patterns and best practices. In parallel, 
                my database skills allow me to design normalized schemas, write complex queries, and optimize data storage and retrieval, which are vital for any data-driven application.
            </p>
            <h4>Security:</h4>
            <p>
